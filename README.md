# Health Notifications
Inspired by plugins like Wintertodt Notifications (https://github.com/jodelahithit/runelite-plugins/tree/wintertodt-notifications), 
this plugin provides a visual notification in the form of a colored overlays when hitpoints or prayer points breach a specific threshold. A tray
notification (for when tabbed out of Runelite) when either threshold is breached can be enabled. There's also combo setting that will allow you to set a third overlay color
when both hitpoints and prayer points are both breaching the configured thresholds.
