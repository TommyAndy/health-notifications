# Health Notifications
Inspired by plugins like Wintertodt Notifications (https://github.com/jodelahithit/runelite-plugins/tree/wintertodt-notifications), 
this plugin provides a visual notification in the form of a colored overlay when hitpoints breach a specific threshold. There is also a tray
notification if tabbed out of Runelite when the threshold is breached.
